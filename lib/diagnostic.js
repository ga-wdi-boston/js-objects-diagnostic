// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for
// keeping track of things. Identify at least two entites such a program might
// need and describe attributes and methods of each.
//
// EXAMPLE
// Description: Our app manages car sales.
// Entity: Car
// Attributes: make, model, year
// Methods: drive, brake, park
//
// Entity: SalesPerson
// Attributes: name, commissionRate
// Methods: sell, call

const carSales = function (make, model, year, price, SalesPerson) {
  this.make = "Audi";
  this.model = "A7";
  this.year = 2012;
  this.car = true;
  this.price = 45000;
  this._salesPerson= function {
    name = "Alexandria"
    commissionRate = 4 * this.price;
  };
};



  }

// 2. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `owner` entity description.
// Store it in the variable below. Be sure to give it reasonable values for each
// of its properties.
//
// Entity: Owner
// Attributes: name, address, numberOfPets

// Replace null with your answer
let owner = null;

// 3. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `pet` entity description.
// Store it in the variable `pet`, below.

// Entity: Pet
// Attributes: name, species, breed, vocalization
// Methods: vocalize

// Replace null with your answer
let pet = null;

// 4. Create a constructor function for pet objects, as described above. The
// constructor function should be responsible for setting the values of `name`,
// `species`, `breed`, and `vocalization`.

const Pet = function () {
  /* Your answer here */
};

// 5. Attach a `vocalize` method to the Pet's prototype.

/* your answer here */

// Don't change this
module.exports = {
  answerTwo: owner,
  answerThree: pet,
  answerFour: Pet,
};
