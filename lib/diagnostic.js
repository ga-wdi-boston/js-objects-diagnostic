// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for
// keeping track of things. Identify at least two entites such a program might
// need and describe attributes and methods of each.
//
// EXAMPLE
// Description: Our app manages car sales.
// Entity: Car
// Attributes: make, model, year
// Methods: drive, brake, park
//
// Entity: SalesPerson
// Attributes: name, commissionRate
// Methods: sell, call

//Description: A calendar that keeps track of the date and allows the user to
//set up a schedule in the app.
//Entity: name of calendar user
//Attributes:


//Entity: Date
//Attributes: Time of start, time ending,
//Methods:  Total Length of Event
//Entity: Name of event,
//Attributes: Address, notes on event
//Method: Alert to the user the event


// 2. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `owner` entity description.
// Store it in the variable below. Be sure to give it reasonable values for each
// of its properties.
//
// Entity: Owner
// Attributes: name, address, numberOfPets

// Replace null with your answer
const Owner = {
    name: 'Alex',
    address: '38 Lincoln Pk, Somerville, MA 02143',
    numberOfPets: 5,
  };
};

// 3. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `pet` entity description.
// Store it in the variable `pet`, below.

// Entity: Pet
// Attributes: name, species, breed, vocalization
// Methods: vocalize

// Replace null with your answer
let pet = {
  name: 'Kiwi',
  species: 'Crested Gecko',
}

// 4. Create a constructor function for pet objects, as described above. The
// constructor function should be responsible for setting the values of `name`,
// `species`, `breed`, and `vocalization`.

const Pet = function() {
  /* Your answer here */
};

// 5. Attach a `vocalize` method to the Pet's prototype.

/* your answer here */

// Don't change this
module.exports = {
  answerTwo: owner,
  answerThree: pet,
  answerFour: Pet
};
