// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for
// keeping track of things. Identify at least two entites such a program might
// need and describe attributes and methods of each.
//
// EXAMPLE
// Description: Our app manages car sales.
// Entity: Car
// Attributes: make, model, year
// Methods: drive, brake, park
//
// Entity: SalesPerson
// Attributes: name, commissionRate
// Methods: sell, call

// 2. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `owner` entity description.
// Store it in the variable below. Be sure to give it reasonable values for each
// of its properties.
//
// Entity: Owner
// Attributes: name, address, numberOfPets

// Replace null with your answer
let owner = {
  name: 'J Beebs',
  address: '55 Nutball Lane';
  numberOfPets: 8
};

// 3. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `pet` entity description.
// Store it in the variable `pet`, below.

// Entity: Pet
// Attributes: name, species, breed, vocalization
// Methods: vocalize

// Replace null with your answer
let pet = {
  name: 'Enrique Iglesias',
  species: 'felis catus',
  breed: 'Exotic shorthair',
  vocalization: 'Meow'
};

// 4. Create a constructor function for pet objects, as described above. The
// constructor function should be responsible for setting the values of `name`,
// `species`, `breed`, and `vocalization`.

const Pet = function() {
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.vocalization = vocalization;
};

// 5. Attach a `vocalize` method to the Pet's prototype.
