// 1. Suppose that we wanted to create a browser-based calendar program for
// keeping track of things. Identify at least two entites such a program might
// need and describe attributes and methods of each.

// EXAMPLE
// Description: Our app manages car sales.
// Entity: Car
// Attributes: make, model, year
// Methods: drive, brake, park
//
// Entity: SalesPerson
// Attributes: name, commissionRate
// Methods: sell, call

Desciption: My calendar will manage appointments and alert users.
Entity: calendar
Attributes: months, holidays, dates
Methods: goToDate, celebrateHoliday

Entity: Day
Attributes: date, appointments
Methods: setDate, changeAppointment



// 2. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `owner` entity
// description. Store it in the variable below. Be sure to give it reasonable
// values for each of its properties.
//
// Entity: Owner
// Attributes: name, address, numberOfPets

// Replace null with your answer
let owner = {
  name: "Ara",
  address: "66 Grosvenor Ave",
  numberOfPets: 9
};

// 3. Create an object literal that lines up with the following `pet` entity
// description. Store it in the variable `pet`, below.

// Entity: Pet
// Attributes: name, species, breed, vocalization
// Methods: vocalize

// Replace null with your answer
let pet = {
  name: "Max",
  species: "cat",
  breed: "tiger",
  vocalization: "purr",
  vocalize: function(){
    console.log("Roarrrrrr!")
  }
};

// 4. Create a constructor function for pet objects, as described above. The
// constructor function should be responsible for setting the values of `name`,
// `species`, `breed`, and `vocalization`.

const Pet = class Pets  {
  constructor(name, species, breed, vocalization){
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.vocalization = vocalization;
};;;;;;;;

// 5. Attach a `vocalize` method to the Pet's prototype.  The `vocalize` method
// should return the pet's vocalization attribute.

Pet.prototype.vocalize()

// Don't change this
module.exports = {
  answerTwo: owner,
  answerThree: pet,
  answerFour: Pet,
};
